In this project we outline various approaches to optimising RTB given a budget constraint. The first approach uses a constant bid across each auction. The next approach generates bid values subject to an upper limit. A linear model is then implemented, where the bid value is proportional to the predicted click through rate. Finally, an optimum model is implemented which outperforms the prior models.
